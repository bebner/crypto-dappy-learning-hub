*Now there's just one thing left to do...* 

*Our users are happy, but they've realised that they can't buy each others Dappies* üëÄ

*We need to fix that, and quickly!* 

*I need you to give this all you've got!*

## The mission brief

Allowing users to buy each others Dappy is central to the marketplace. The transaction that allows us to do that is quite big, but we will take it step by step. The starting branch for this mission is market-mission-4, but you can continue with your project from the last mission.

## Buy Dappy On Market

Ok, let's do this! Join me as we create the transaction that allows us to buy Dappies from the market!
