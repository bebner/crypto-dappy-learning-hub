*Users can list their Dappies on the market. but they can't yet see other users' Dappies...* 👁️

*We need to fix that* ⚒️

## The mission brief

This mission is all about updating the market. You will learn how we interface with the backend to achieve this, and the approach that we use (polling) to keep the market up-to-date. The starting branch for this mission is market-mission-2, but feel free to continue with your own project from the previous lesson.

## Update Market Background
