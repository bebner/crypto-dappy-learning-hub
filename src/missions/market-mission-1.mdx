### Gunnar Dappy

Senior Developer

*Congratulations on the success of CryptoDappy, you've done amazing!* ðŸŽ‰

*Problem is though, that our inboxes have been inundated with a new feature request ðŸ“©*

*The public are insisting that we build a marketplace for them to trade their Dappies on*

*There's one problem though... No-one on the team knows how to build a marketplace! ðŸ‘€*

*We need you to carry the team on this one (again), do some research and figure out how to do it before it's too late!*

*Let's get to it!*

## NFTStorefront Contract

The NFTStorefront contract allows us to create marketplaces for our NFTs. Let's learn about how asset ownership on Flow is different to other blockchains, how we keep track of assets, and how the NFTStorefront contract comes into play.
