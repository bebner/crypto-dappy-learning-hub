Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁî®

Congrats to your new job üéâ You have just joined the next big startup everyone is talking about: **CryptoDappy**. 
The team led by CEO Rhea Dappy has an ambitious plan: building the best collectibles platform ever made - on the blockchain!
Because they want their application to scale for the mass audience with a seamless user experience, 
they chose Flow as the blockchain to build upon. With Flow, they get scalability paired with easy 
onboarding experiences for users and developers. If only it wasn't so hard to get skilled devs!

That's where you come in: Although you have written one or two lines of code in your life before, 
you know only little about Blockchain or Flow. *But that's about to change!* The team has prepared dedicated learning assignments for you, so that you can get up to speed with 
the technical aspects quickly while already contributing to the V1.0 of their collectibles game CryptoDappy.

## What you'll learn

In this course, you will learn everything you need to know to get started fast building blockchain applications on Flow. Specifically you will learn how to

- authenticate users with a blockchain wallet
- query blockchain data with scripts
- interact with smart contracts by using transactions
- write, test and deploy your own smart contracts
- and sell your own digital assets by integrating a payment system into your application


## What you'll be building

CryptoDappy is a **collectibles game** where users can collect cute little Dappies 
by either buying them individually in the store, or by taking part in **Dappy Drops**, 
where packs of Dappies are available for purchase. At any point in time, users can sign 
into the application, look at their **Dappy collection** and open packs they have purchased before.

From a technical perspective, CryptoDappy consists of a React frontend and a collection 
of smart contracts written in Cadence, the smart contract programming language of Flow. 

At the end of the course, you can deploy the fully-functional application to testnet 
and add it to your blockchain developer portfolio. Also, you can use it as a starter 
template to write your own application.

## How you'll learn

We'll build CryptoDappies in various **mission-based scenarios** that combine the 
theoretical aspects you need to know with hands-on code walkthroughs. Each mission contains:

- **The mission brief**: Here you'll find all the mission's outcomes and learning goals at one glance.
- **Learning content:** In this part you will get the knowledge foundation needed for the features you'll build in the mission
- **Project walkthrough:** This is the actual work on the CryptoDappy project that you can follow along


## Where to get help?

If you feel stuck building the project or you have any questions regarding the course, you can get help in
the dedicated [Flow community forum](https://forum.onflow.org/c/community-projects/cryptodappy/35).
