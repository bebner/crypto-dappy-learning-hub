You have just joined the next big startup everyone is talking about: CryptoDappy. The team around CEO Rhea Dappy has an ambitious plan: building the best collectibles game ever made - on the blockchain!

Although you have written one or two lines of code in your life before, you know nothing about Flow or its languages and tools. But that's about to change! 

The team has prepared dedicated learning assignments for you, so that you can get up to speed with the technical aspects quickly while already contributing to the V1.0 of their collectibles game CryptoDappy. 

After a general high-level overview, it's time to dive into the nitty-gritty details of the application's initial structure and the patterns being used. Take a look at [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) if you're feeling a bit shaky on these topics.
