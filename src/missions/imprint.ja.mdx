According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider, we are not obliged to monitor 
transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that

of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the 
time they were linked. No illegal content was found at the time the link was created.

evidence of a violation of the law. As soon as we become aware of legal violations, 
we will remove such links immediately.
