### Ramona Dappy

Customer Experience Manager

*You are officially the marketplace expert on the CryptoDappy team!* 🤓

*Now that you know your stuff, we need you to start building the marketplace for all of our avid fans 🏟️*

*The first thing that we would like you to tackle is the listing of Dappies on the market*

*Since our fans are so desperate to get their own dappies on the market, this should keep them quiet for a while 🤫*

*Get on with it!*
