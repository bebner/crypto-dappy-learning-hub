### Ramona Dappy

Customer Experience Manager

*You are officially the marketplace expert on the CryptoDappy team!* 🤓

*Now that you know your stuff, we need you to start building the marketplace for all of our avid fans* 🏟️

*The first thing that we would like you to tackle is the listing of Dappies on the market*

*Since our fans are so desperate to get their own dappies on the market, this should keep them quiet for a while *🤫

*Get on with it!*

## The mission brief

In this mission, you will learn how to add the functionality that allows users to list their Dappy on the market. By doing this, a Listing resource will be created which represents the Dappy on the market.

## Introductory Video

Before we start doing any coding, we must familiarise ourselves with the market-starter application. **In order to complete the market missions tutorial, we strongly advise you to start with the market-starter branch!**
