Nice work, now our marketplace updates and shows us the most recently listed Dappies!... But we're not finished yet, because our users can't remove their Dappies from the market! Let's fix that!

### Cecil Dappy

Senior Developer

*Ok, we've had a few complaints from users... They aren't yet able to remove their Dappies from the market!* ‚ùå

*Some users are being a little bit selfish and want to keep their Dappies to themselves* ü•∫

*I suppose we are going to have to implement functionality that allows them to remove their Dappies?*

*What do you think?* ‚ùì

## The mission brief

In this mission, we will code the transaction that allows users to remove Dappies from the marketplace. Only the owner of the Dappy Listing will be able to remove the Dappy from the market. The starting branch for this mission is market-mission-3, but feel free to use your project from the previous mission.

## Remove Dappy From Market

So how do we remove a Dappy from the market? With a transaction of course!
