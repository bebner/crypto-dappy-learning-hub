## The mission brief

This mission is all about minting Dappies using transactions.

The starting branch for this mission is *[mission-5](https://github.com/bebner/crypto-dappy/tree/mission-5)*


## Preparation: listing user dappies

We'll get into the groove smoothly by doing something we already know very well: Writing scripts! This time, it's all about querying for a user's dappies.

## The big milestone: minting Dappies

The final big milestone of your first assessment is here: Minting the first Dappy! After completing this video, your users will be able to mint Dappies to their collection, paying for them in FUSD.

## Housekeeping: transaction provider

After we reached our big milestone of minting Dappies, let's now take some time for housekeeping: 
Our transaction provider. This provider gives users visual feedback on their running 
transactions and avoids putting in multiple transactions at once.
